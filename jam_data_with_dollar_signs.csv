Not everything has to be related to it of course, but it should be featured throughout. This basically means that you can't feature pregnancy in one scene only/just as an ending.  -Showing birth is permitted, though any human (or human-adjacent) children cannot simply be abandoned. It is up to the game's creator how they handle this, an example would be putting in a nursery or similar facility that would take in any children.  -NSFW content is permitted as well, though a warning must be put in to let the players know.  -Any and all games must comply with itch.io's own rules of content  -Creators are not bound to a specific engine or type of game; Anything from Text Adventure to 3D game is permitted  -Fetishes besides pregnancy can be included in games, though they shouldn't shift focus away from pregnancy and need to be disclosed in a warning similar to NSFW contentContest and Rewards...At the end of the month, a few select judges will be going over all the submitted games. The top 3 games that have the best scores will be offered a choice of a $60 cash prize or one free full body art commission from a few select artists in the community. In order to be eligible for rewards, your project must be playable on a windows platform.Criteria that the judges will base their scores will be focused in three different areas.-Pregnancy Content-Story-GameplaySpecial Notes:-If your game is chosen as a winner and you wish to receive a cash reward, you will need to have a paypal account.-If your game is chosen as a winner and you wish to have character art created, I will send you a list of approved artists that you can pick from.
