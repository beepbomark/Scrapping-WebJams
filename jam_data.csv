330019,https://itch.io/jam/indiepocalypse-issue-41-paying-anthology,Indiepocalypse Issue #41 (Paying Anthology),187,"Hello! Welcome to the entry page for issue #41 Indiepocalypse Zine! 
What is this thing anyway? 
Simply, it's a monthly collection of  games from 10 developers all wrapped up in one package. That the developers get paid for! Up front and on the back end! There will also be a short digital zine with a page for each game. Creators are free to design their page to their own liking or submit text and pictures to be laid out for them.
The games are then sold through itch in a single zipped file with a launcher.
You will be paid:
UP FRONT: $20 USD   
BACK END: 5% of sales (before anthology breaks even) | 8% (after)  
Also, I claim no exclusivity or ownership of your games!

Game Requirements
This simply a submission page for the zine. I do not consider it a jam and would encourage others to do the same. If you want to make a new game for the zine (and I'm not commissioning you) more power to you I guess.
-Games can (and should) already be complete and can have been made at any point in time.-Games can be of any theme   
-Games can be of any length  
-Games can be digital or physical (that can be distributed digitally)  but must be in some way downloadable. This includes mobile games.
-Games can play very loosely with the term 'game'  
-Any number of games can be submitted but each person can only occupy one slot.-I have no way to play VR-only games, everything else should be fine.-Make your game playable without me having to find a way load up the project file in whatever engine you made it in
That's pretty much it. Everyone keeps ownership of all their stuff, this is mostly a way to give a platform (and money) to smaller and/or more unknown projects.
How are games selected?
Games are selected by a single curator (me) based on no strict criteria at all. The main goal each month is to make an interesting and diverse zine. Below are some things that I think about when choosing games. Indiepocalypse was created with the intent of being a collection of alternative and outsider works so bear that in mind when submitting. Also, while TTRPGs are accepted (and sometimes even commission) my focus is on the vaguely defined medium of ""video games"". As such I tend to include 2~3 TTRPGs at most per issue.
This is by no means a list of objectives to meet and there is no objective math way of breaking down and judging a game and anyone who claims otherwise is lying.
-Subjective taste is ultimately unavoidable-I prefer things that are messy and interesting to ones that are polished and familiar-Complete is preferable to demos/betas-Each issue will try to a have a diverse selection of games, even if the 10 best fighting games ever made were submitted only like, 2, would be included-Length is irrelevant-I am typically detached from (if not exhausted by) trends in design-You gotta really try for something if you're making a overhead/twin-stick shooter -Execution on intent (or something to the effect) is what I look to when I find a game feels more personally uninteresting than broadly uninteresting (however possible it is to determine such a thing)
Incomplete list of things I try to avoid judging unfairly but generally do not like and hey, I'm just a person so that's how things are-Tiny (relative) hit boxes on melee attacks-Built in physics, especially where meaningful control matters 
What if my game is selected?
After submission entries are curated, if your game is selected, you'll be contacted  and given a form to fill out to collect the materials for the magazine and anything else that may be needed. If you submitted multiple games, you will either: Be sent a message telling you which game was selected OR Receive no additional message and have your choice of bundling the games one entry/choose which game you'd like to be included.

Selections are not made public until the issue is released.  Everyone will receive an email through itch once the games are chosen. If that is the only email you received, your game was not selected.

Games chosen are in no way way exclusive to Indiepocalypse and can remain on your itch page or anywhere else for any price you want. The games chosen are made public when the issue is released.
The zine favors new contributors and will likely not repeat contributors for at least TBD months.

329046,https://itch.io/jam/bullet-hell-jam-2023,Bullet Hell Jam 2023,1413,"Welcome to BULLET HELL JAM!
This is the FOURTH annual bullet hell jam - spend 10 days cramming as many bullets as you can
    into a short game, and get a ton of great feedback at the end. Oh, and did we mention that there's a little prize?

THEME: ""LIMITED""





Inspiration











Prizes/Free Stuff!!!!
THE WINNING GAME WILL GET $25 - the top game in the ""Overall"" category will get $25. They will have to have a bank account that can receive money from the UK, or a PayPal account.
For the duration of the jam, Wayfarer Games is making the unity asset   BulletFury free to use (usually $25). The top three games in the
    ""Overall"" category will get a Unity Asset Store key for it, too. You do not have to use BulletFury, or Unity! The asset is designed around performance, plus you won't have to think about spawning bullets, but it is entirely optional.
BULLETFURY FREE DEMO
The winner in the ""Overall"" category will get a shiny role on our Discord server, too!
Guidelines

You should incorporate some aspect of the bullet hell genre, or projectiles, into your game.
    
There will be a separate, optional theme, announced when the jam starts.
Youâre allowed to jam by yourself, or in teams, and there is no limit on team size. However, keep in mind that large teams are difficult to manage over short periods of time.
Preferably a playable Windows or WebGL build, however supporting other platforms is encouraged,
        such as macOS and Linux.
    
English is required for major text in your game.
    
If your game contains disturbing or otherwise NSFW content you must add appropriate
            warnings.

Ratings
Ratings will be based on:


THEME - How well does the game fit the theme? Or maybe it uses
        the theme in an interesting and unique way.
    

AUDIO - How good does the game
        sound? This isnât necessarily about technical skill here, do the music and sound effects fit the gameplay?
    

VISUAL - How good does the game
        look? This isnât necessarily about technical skill here, are the graphics consistent? Does the overall look fit the gameplay?
    

FUN - How fun was it to play? Did the game have the right
        amount of challenge? Did you enjoy the experience?
    

OVERALL - Your overall score for the game, taking into
        consideration your general impression of
        it after all of this ^^.
    

Q&A

Can I use [x engine]?
Yes! Absolutely, use whatever engine you like. Unity, Godot, Unreal, your own custom engine
        - everything goes.
Do I have to use Bulletfury?
Nope, not at all. I made the asset, it fits the overall aim of the jam, so I thought I'd make it free - that's
        all ð
How ""bullet hell"" does my game have to be?
You'll be fine as long as you loosely incorporate bullets/projectiles or some aspect of bullet hell games into
        your project.
    
Can I use premade assets, scripts, or ideas?
Yes! When it comes to assets you can use them as long as they follow these guidelines.
    

The asset is general purpose. (Things like character controllers )
        
You have the rights to use them.
        
Write which assets were made before the jam in your description.
        
Credit any assets you don't own in the description.
        

As for ideas, you are free to plan out your game before the jam starts, and also remember the theme!
Can I submit my old game or start working on my game before the jam starts?
The majority of your game should be made during the jam, premade assets are an
        exception to this and can be made before the jam starts, following the guidelines stated above.
    
This is my first time making a bullet hell, where do I start?
You can start with the resources and tutorials listed here.
    
How much time do we have?
You have 10 days to create your game and submit it to the jam. After that there will be a rating period that will
        last another week before we announce the results. During the rating period, submissions will be locked - no
        bugfixes allowed. This is a game jam, it's not supposed to be perfect!
Where can I ask more questions about the jam?
There are 2 main places. You can ask on OUR DISCORD SERVER, or you
        can go to the community tab right here on itch and ask there! There will be plenty of people willing to help!
        Lots of people are new to game jams here, and if you are one of them, there are a bunch of experienced jammers
        who can answer any doubts or questions related to participating in game jams in general.

Experts
Panel of experts giving feedback to your entries (with their top5 picks each), or judging games from given Challenges. Those are: Michelle Mannering, Ewa Mazur, Ania KubÃ³w, Raf Mertens, Rafael Morgan, Leon Do, Brett Cleary, Daniel Keller, Tim Sulmone, Paul Gadi, Taufik Sani, Allan Patel, Joe Carnell, and Dominic Smith.
Engines
You are free to use any game engine or library as long as the build/export is playable in the browser. We recommend using Phaser, Defold, or GDevelop, you might also consider Cocos or 8XR, if you'd like to aim for multiplayer you can check Colyseus or Modd.io, and if you need an extra challenge, you can try the js13kGames-specific size-constraint ones like Kontra, Goodluck, or LittleJS. 
Rules
The short version is: anything that can run on the Web in a browser   without extra plugins is considered a valid jam entry. It's highly   advised you create new content for the jam - submitting your old demos or already finished projects makes no sense.         
If you have any questions or concerns please ask at the Community forums or join our Discord server."
330229,https://itch.io/jam/gdevelop-3d-jam,GDevelop 3D Jam,374,"This is an event in which you'll have 9 days to create 3D games using GDevelop, the free and open-source game engine. You can create a 3D game with GDevelop using PANDAKO's 3D extension, or the new 3D box object that is currently in development. Once the submission period is over, your game will get rated by other participants, and you will also get to rate other games. 
The GDevelop Game Jam will be a fun, diverse, and inclusive event in which you'll get to put your skills to the test. There will be participants from all over the world, and you will have the opportunity to chat with other developers, discuss each other's games and of course, create a game from start to finish! 

You need to register for the event right here on itch.io in order to participate. Please also join our Discord server for all information and notifications regarding the jam, and to meet the other participants. 

Whether you finish your game or not, you'll have an amazing experience, learn tons and meet cool people from around the world!

329514,https://itch.io/jam/earthquake-relief-bundle-for-turkiye-syria,Earthquake Relief Bundle for Turkiye & Syria,170,"TÃ¼rkiye & Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle

This is a charity bundle to aid folks affected by the earthquake in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria. 
We are Play for TÃ¼rkiye, a community-driven initiative representing the diverse Turkish game development community. Our mission is to empower game developers to create social impactA devastating earthquake struck TÃ¼rkiye and Syria leveling multiple cities. More than 50,000 people have already perished in the destruction. Millions more are left without a home, access to food, or warm clothes to wear. We can help them, today.
What we have done so far;

- Collaborated with Humble Bundle for another Earthquake relief bundle and raised 3.5M$ for the ones in need. 
- We work closely with international bodies like GGJ and WIG to raise awareness and get donations for the cause.

The money raised through this charity bundle will be distributed through the Turkish Philanthropy Fund (TPF) to charities that are active in the Turkish and Syrian region. The selected charities are Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, and White Helmets. The money will be used to:

Provide food and emergency medical supplies to people and animals,
Support temporary relief and emergency supplies for displaced families,
Provide support to front-line workers,
Provide psycho-social and mental health support to survivors,
Support economic relief efforts,
Support long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts.

You can learn more about TPFâs ongoing earthquake relief efforts here.




Join the bundle by submitting your game to this Jam. 
------------------------------------------------         
F.A.Q.

How do I join the bundle?
Submit your game to this game jam!
After the jam ends you will get a notification from itch.io to approve your participation to the bundle, if your game is included. 
How does the money stuff work?
The money goes directly to itch.io and will then be transferred to the Turkish Philanthropy Fund which will distribute it. So Play for TÃ¼rkiye will not store any of it.

Does joining the game jam automatically mean my game is included in the bundle?
No, there is a vetting process. We will be ensuring each submission runs and doesn't contain any malware. We will also be filtering for low effort bad faith submissions. 
Can I submit free projects?

Yes!  However, we ask you to only submit a piece if you believe in it. Previous free items in the bundles caused concern and reduced the bundle's perceived value, yet as creators, we know that the value of a piece work isn't always captured in its price.
Can I submit multiple things?
Sure. You need to submit them seperately.
Can I submit non-games?

Any project page on itch.io with a URL is acceptable.

Can I submit adult content?

No, sorry! We aim to make this bundle media-friendly to achieve maximum reach, as people tend to be sensitive. Please exercise your judgment accordingly.

Will Steam (or other external keys) be given with a purchase?

No, we cannot consider non-itch.io projects for this bundle as coordinating with them can be challenging and may attract scammers. Therefore, only itch.io projects will be taken into account.

I'm worried people might already have my game from another bundle.

That's fine. While we do want to include as much new content as we can, some people have yet to play your game!



Thank you everyone for contributing to this charity bundle."

Welcome to the p5.js Game Jam #2
                      
This is a 72-hour game jam that is held every month specifically for p5.js coders! (hosted by a coder in the p5 community)
Time:
Apr 14: Theme is announced + jam starts at 12pm noon GMTApr 17: Jam ends + voting starts at 12pm noon GMTApr 23: Voting ends + results at 12pm noon GMT!!


                    
And this jam's theme IS...

WHAT LIES BENEATH!
Sounds SCARY! You may think this limit your game to horror, but your game could be of any genre you can think of: adventure, platformer, rpg...
Theme is optional but remember, it is a criteria!! That being said,
HAPPY CODING!

                      
Ratings is set to public, meaning everyone can rate!
There will be 4 categories to rate:
Enjoyment: How does the game feel? Is it fun?...Creativity: How original, creative the game is...Theme: Does the game stick to the theme or at the very least has some sense of the theme in it?Art + Audio: Does the game have great graphics/sfx/music?...

                      
Here are some of the rules we must all go by:
All projects must be made from p5.js (or any language associates with the Processing Foundation). I have my own way of finding it out! :) You can use any kind of text editor or engine (vscode, sublime, notepad++, ...) but only with languages linking with the Processing Foundation (preferably p5.js)!Anyone can participate in the jam, no matter whether he or she are an experienced coder or just started their first project!! Although those below 13 years of age should have a parent or guardian to upload their games.
The majority of the game must be made during the jam. That means you cannot submit pre-made games (we do check). Yes, you can use pre-existing code/sfx/music if you have the rights but I would recommend building from scratch! :)You must upload the game onto itch.io and pricing must be ""no payments"" or ""$0 or donate"". Anyone who simply just puts a link to the project in the description will be disqualified. Also, try to make the game easy to access; players can download and play right away, or just play the game in browser!
No NSFW, gore/violence content or rude language. Keep this page as clean as your code ð
No cheating with theme poll.You cannot edit your submissions after voting has begun.No vote hacking.Be polite! If you see any kind of bullying, you can always report!

If you want to find teammates, show everyone your game, or simply chat with others, this is the official discord group for this jam! :)

Well that is it! :) If there is anything confusing, just ask me in the community section! :)
There is no prize (except getting featured in future jams), but remember, this is just for fun! The sole purpose of this jam is to push this small but amazing community to thrive!! So, with that being said, have a great weekend everybody ð
Check out the p5.js library, online editor, reference sheet; or the Processing Foundation page!
Teeny tiny tip: follow me on twitter, where I will more likely publish the theme on time hehe :) itch.io doesn't have schedule mode so... ð

A The Guardian Jam Ã© um evento hosteado pela The Guardian Dog Studio, empresa jÃºnior de desenvolvimento de jogos do curso de Sistemas e MÃ­dias Digitais, pertencente Ã  Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ (UFC). Ã uma Jam de estudantes, para estudantes!
TÃ¡, mas o que Ã© uma Game Jam?
Uma Game Jam Ã© um evento de desenvolvimento de jogos que geralmente dura apenas alguns dias. Durante o perÃ­odo, os times participantes tentam desenvolver um jogo jogÃ¡vel e que siga a temÃ¡tica do evento, geralmente sendo avaliados pelo pÃºblico e pela comissÃ£o ao final do perÃ­odo.E a regra Ã© clara: O tempo Ã© curto, entÃ£o K.I.S.SKeepItSimple andShort

Qual serÃ¡ o tema?
O tema da jam Ã©! ""O Melhor Amigo do Homem""! Vamos comeÃ§ar a trabalhar!

Como posso participar?
Ã bem simples, na realidade. Basta clicar no botÃ£o ""Join Jam"" acima e vocÃª serÃ¡ registrado como um participante! Se estiver trabalhando com uma equipe, apenas um dos integrantes precisa participar, apesar de que Ã© interessante que todos entrem para evitar imprevistos. Ao final da Jam apenas um integrante deve enviar o jogo. O processo de envio do jogo Ã© diferente da inscriÃ§Ã£o.A Ãºnica limitaÃ§Ã£o para a participaÃ§Ã£o na The Guardian Jam Ã© se vocÃª nÃ£o Ã© graduando na Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡. As inscriÃ§Ãµes nÃ£o se limitam ao curso de Sistemas e MÃ­dias Digitais, se vocÃª Ã© estudante da UFC, pode vir!

NÃ£o tenho equipe, o que fazer?
NÃ³s temos um servidor no Discord para a comunidade! Se ainda nÃ£o tem um time em mente ou quer ser adotado por um que precise membros, vocÃª pode ir para o servidor e conversar com outras pessoas para unirem forÃ§as!Aqui estÃ¡ o link do Discord: https://discord.gg/bXkS2ueS2S(Lembrando que em Ãºltima instÃ¢ncia, apesar de nÃ£o recomendado, o projeto ainda pode ser feito sozinho.)

Como posso dar submit no meu jogo?
Siga o guia: https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-4/topic/2299219/how-to-submit-your-gameE nÃ£o esqueÃ§am: Podem entrar em contato conosco durante o perÃ­odo da Jam, faremos o nosso melhor para garantir que os jogos de todos sejam submetidos.

Sim e sim! O perÃ­odo de votaÃ§Ãµes ocorrerÃ¡ entre os dias 16 e 23 de abril e o resultado final serÃ¡ revelado no dia 24 de abril! Qualquer participante da Jam pode jogar e votar nos jogos submetidos.Sobre os prÃªmios: As 3 equipes com a melhor pontuaÃ§Ã£o mÃ©dia receberÃ£o R$25! JÃ¡ dÃ¡ uma pizza de comemoraÃ§Ã£o!

Como meu jogo serÃ¡ avaliado?
A avaliaÃ§Ã£o conta com 4 critÃ©rios: DiversÃ£o, Visuais, Design de Som e InovaÃ§Ã£o. A pontuaÃ§Ã£o mÃ©dia serÃ¡ um resultado dessas 4 pontuaÃ§Ãµes. As melhores equipes serÃ£o decididas com base nas melhores pontuaÃ§Ãµes mÃ©dias.Mas para cada critÃ©rio haverÃ¡ um top 3! Caso seu jogo nÃ£o esteja entre os top 3 Geral, ele ainda pode estar em destaque! (SÃ³ nÃ£o haverÃ¡ premiaÃ§Ãµes para os melhores de cada categoria)

EU NUNCA PARTICIPEI DE UMA JAM
NÃ£o se preocupe! Temos noÃ§Ã£o de que muitas pessoas interessadas nunca participaram de uma Game Jam antes. Nossa proposta Ã© ajudar vocÃªs com mentorias de como dar os primeiros passos e abordar um evento como uma Game Jam.Precisa de dicas para Game Engines? Onde achar assets? Ferramentas para desenvolver o jogo? As mentorias vÃ£o tentar esclarecer isso da melhor forma possÃ­vel!------------------------------------- English Description -------------------------------------The Guardian Jam is a Game Jam hosted by The Guardian Dog Studio, a game development Junior Enterprise from Sistemas e MÃ­dias Digitais, an undergraduation course from Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ (UFC)! It's a Jam built by students for students! 
Wait, what the heck is a Game Jam?
A Game Jam is a Game Development Event where teams do  their best to develop a game following a theme  and in a short period of time. Teams have to meet ends to release an  at least playable build in the course of a few  days, mostly focusing on following the ancestral law  KISS, ""Keep It Simple and Short"".
    
What's the theme?
The theme for this jam is! ""O Melhor Amigo do Homem""! Let's start working!
    
How can I join?
It's quite simple! Just press the join button above and you'll be  registered as a participant in the Jam! Not everyone on the team has to  do it, but multiple people from the same group joining doesn't mean one  game for each. The submission is a process apart from joining!
    
Only Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡ undergraduates (graduandos) can participate in The Guardian Jam! But you can be from any course, not only Sistemas e MÃ­dias Digitais!
    
Where do I find teams?
We have a dedicated Discord server for our community! If you don't  have a team yet, you can join our discord server and look out for people  to join forces!
Here's the link: https://discord.gg/bXkS2ueS2S
(If it is absolutely necessary, the project can still be done alone, but it's not recommended)
    
How can I submit my game?
Follow this guide on how to submit your entry! https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-4/topic/2299219/how-to-submit-your-game
Contact  us at anytime during the submission stage for help! If for any reason  you can't upload your game, we'll do our best to make sure your entry is  submited. JUST DON'T FORGET TO CONTACT US!!!
    
Will there be voting and prizes?
Yes and yes! The voting period is between the 16th and the 23rd and  the final result of the Jam will be revealed on April 24! Any  participant can vote in any game! We'll have guests playing your games  and voting too! 
    
For prizes, the Top 3 Overall teams will get 25 R$ each! Enough for a celebration pizza! 
    
How will my game be rated?
Games will be voted in these four categories: Enjoyment, Aesthetics, Sound Design and Innovation. A  fifth category named Overall will be created by calculating the average  between those four! The Top 3 Overall teams will then be chosen based  on that last category.
    
But for each of the first four we'll be having a Top 3! Top 3  Enjoyment, Top 3 Aesthetics, and so on! These won't hold any prizes but  games will be highlighted.
    
Oh no! I never participated in a Game Jam before!
Worry not! We have something special for The Guardian Jam  participants! During the first days we'll have a group of mentors  helping with teams' first steps. Need help with finding a nice Game  Engine? Or want recommendations for places to download Assets? Tools?  Tips for organizing schedule? Fear not! Our mentor team will do their  best to give everyone swords to fight any danger!
    
F.A.Q.
I have some assets I made before, can I use them in my game?
Absolutely! As long as it makes sense in the current project, we  encourage you to use any pre-existing assets for the sake of  simplifiying and speeding up the project's develpment.
    
Am I allowed to use free assets?
Of course! If you have the legal right to use them, you should  absolutely do. There are many free repositories for game assets you can  use to simplify things. If there's any confusion about that, you can  always reach out to us asking for clarification or orientations in any  way. And dont forget!!!! Give the author credit where's due!!"

For a more retro Macintosh experience, target Mac OS 9 or earlier.
All PC-9800 series computers are valid targets.
Macromedia Flash, by request (as long as it runs on a computer made pre-2003).
PLEASE NOTE:  As of RPJ#6, due to the addition of a prize pool, PICO-8, WASM4, and other fantasy consoles are no longer allowed. Sorry!This may disappoint some of you, but the primary objective of this jam is to develop a retro game that runs on real, older hardware. Unfortunately, even with artificial restrictions, fantasy consoles give unfair advantages over developing on real hardware.

Rules
You may use any assets you have the rights to use. This includes libraries, frameworks, engines, external tools, and previously-made graphics or audio.
Games must be either new or ported to a new platform. The game cannot have been released to players or submitted to a Jam previously unless a port to a new platform is submitted to the Jam. The submission must be exclusive for Retro Platform Jam until after the prize pol has been distributed. Your submission should specify which emulators or hardware revisions your game has been tested on. Users on the RetroDev Discord server may be available to help test your game on hardware, at their discretion.
Team submissions are accepted with no team size restrictions.
No excessively NSFW content (we don't want to censor), but no sexism, racism, discrimination or any kind of exclusion is allowed.

If possible, we heavily suggest you record and upload a video of your game running on an emulator or hardware. This is especially important if your game runs on a lesser-known or difficult-to-emulate platform.

Voting
Games will be rated by participants and contributors in the following areas:

Fun - how fun is the game to play? How good does gameplay feel?
Game Design - how well is the game constructed? Do the game systems work together to make a cohesive whole? Are there innovative game mechanics or concepts?
Platform Usage - this is basically our graphics and audio category, but submissions might be for platforms with radically different capabilities. Do the graphics and audio represent the standards and style of the chosen platform? Are the graphics and audio aesthetically pleasing and/or creative?
Theme - how well does the game use the Jamâs theme? How creative is the gameâs interpretation of the theme?

(Note that when voting, a few words as a brief review or notes on your experience is now required.)

330020,https://itch.io/jam/broken-inside,Broken Inside Jam,43,"hi
this is a game jam where any developer can participate including you, and where you can be creative inside the endless world of mental illnesses. it's a place where you can express the pain and the suffering that you carry within you, and maybe even find a glimmer of hope in the darkness.

rules
the rules of this game jam are pretty simple. participants are tasked with creating a game that explores some aspects of mental illness made after that jam starts. i don't mind if you dive deep into the dark waters of depression, anxiety, or any other mental illness, but you must do it with caution and sensitivity. i don't want to see any depiction of self-harm, suicide, nsfw, or graphic violence related to mental illness unless you put a warning on the boot screen.
you can make the game about how you are/were suffering from any kind of mental illness, or you can try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is struggling. but whatever you choose to do, remember that this game jam is not just about making a game, it's about creating something that speaks to the soul.
other rules as any game jam like any game engine is allowed, doesn't matter if you're using unity, godot, unreal engine or a custom engine, you can use ai tools or assets by crediting the creator.

theme
the theme is: loneliness 
the theme will be announced two hours before the jam starts on the discord server, and as the jam starts, i'll also write the theme here. the theme is a word that will guide you on your journey, a word that will challenge you to dig deeper and face the pain that you carry within you.

prizes
the top 3 games will be listed on the top of this page after the game jam is over.

1st place will receive a 5$ gift card.2nd to 10th will receive high-quality stickers made for their game.
the winners will only receive their prizes if only they were in the discord server before the voting period starts.
the 1st place prize would only be available if the jam got â¥30 submissions! (ONLY REAL GAMES ALLOWED, BLANK SCREEN AND CALCULATORS ARE SUBTRACTED FROM THE SUBMISSIONS)
judging criteria
the games will be judged based on how they affected me negatively, which is not an easy task considering the nature of this game jam. i will also be looking at the use of theme, creativity, gameplay, art and visuals, music and sound effects. but above all, i will be looking for the game that speaks to me on a personal level, the game that makes me feel something that i didn't know i could feel.
how the game negatively affected on me

discord
if you want to join the discord server to share your progress and get some inspirations. but be warned, the journey ahead is not an easy one. it's a journey through the darkest corners of the human soul, a journey that will leave you exhausted and drained. but it's also a journey that might just save your life.

the jam will run for a total of five days, giving participants plenty of time to create and refine their games before submission. don't forget to join my discord server for updates, support, and to connect with other participants. hope to see you there.

328097,https://itch.io/jam/goedware-game-jam-8,GoedWare Game Jam #8 (+ prizes ð),150,"This is the 8th Game Jam organized by GoedWare ( LinkedIn | Website | Discord ).  Our goal is to let you practice coding, create and finish a game in 10 days and also learn from the experience, expand your skills and above all have fun and enjoy making your own game and playing other participants' games.

*(Link to previous Jams #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7)


It is always challenging to find an engaging theme. It should provide a solid foundation for game ideas while remaining versatile enough to accommodate diverse concepts. We believe we've discovered that  with our theme: 
""ECOSYSTEM""





Some inspiration: the theme ECOSYSTEM allows for exploration of various aspects, such as environmental balance, species interactions, and conservation efforts. For instance, you could create a game that focuses on maintaining a delicate balance between predators and prey, or one that revolves around restoring a damaged habitat to its former glory. Another idea could be to develop a strategy game where players manage resources and make decisions to ensure the survival and thriving of a diverse ecosystem. You might also consider designing a puzzle game centered around creating symbiotic relationships between species to overcome obstacles or even an adventure game where players assume the role of a guardian of a fragile ecosystem, protecting it from various threats.

Additional ideas include creating a simulation game that models the impact of climate change on ecosystems, an educational game that teaches players about the importance of biodiversity, or an interactive narrative that explores the consequences of human actions on the environment.

We hope that your creativity and skills can transform these concepts into captivating, enjoyable experiences with exceptional gameplay... Think outside the box ð¤ð!

You can always discuss, brainstorm and exchange ideas with your fellow participants @ our Discord Server.

Good luck to you all and have fun at this Game Jam!!
PS: here you can find a mindmap that could be of help. Feel free to use it as a starting point, reference, or simply for inspiration as you work on your game concepts. It's just to help get your creative juices flowing.


Anyone, regardless of experience, is welcome to participate!
An itch.io account to be able to join the jam and submit your entry.
You can use any engine or framework you like! For example: Unity, Godot, Unreal, Gamemaker etc. You can even make your own if you want. But some of our prizes are Assets for the Unity Engine (you can choose a gift card instead).
You will have to create a Devlog where you give some insights in your game development progress or inform the other participants how you solved a specific game problem or implemented a game mechanic. In this way we all learn something from each other's experiences.This can be a blog, a video, your daily schedule of the jam, some text or a short story telling us how you made the game, what difficulties you had during the jam and how you solved them. Or an explanation of some of your key game mechanics. How did you come up with them or how did you implement them. Or what you think are important learning milestones for us. It does not have to be much. Every information you can share will be helpful for us to learn to make better games that are more fun for the players.
 You can easily add your log to your Itch.io Game Project page or provide a link in the submission where we can read your log.

You can not edit your submission after the deadline! So be wise and submit your game a few hours before the deadline to be able to tackle any last minute issues.
Teams are allowed, but we recommend keeping the teams up to 4 members, after that it becomes hard to manage a team in 8 days for a game. (Prizes are only for the whole team, not the individual members)
If you have the time and can manage it, multiple entries for the Game Jam are allowed.
Music must be royalty / copyright free and properly credited. 
You can use fonts from the internet, as long as you have the correct license for it.
You can use assets you own. For example assets from the Unity Asset Store or Unreal Marketplace.
Please only use assets you have permission to use, and avoid infringing upon any copyright or trademark.
No NSFW games.  Games must not contain nudity, or hateful language or visuals.
Participants who try to manipulate voting will be removed.


All entries will be judged by other participants of the jam, so that includes you (hopefully)!

The categories the games are rated in are:

Gameplay: How fun is it to play the game
Graphics: How nice are the look and feel and art-style of the game
Audio: Do your ears love the sound effects and music and do they fit the game and theme
Theme: Does the game fit into the theme
Devlog: How insightful and educational was the log of the developer(s)

There will also be a Judge/Jury Ranking: a rating by our own panel of judges. They will make a separate ranking from the participating games based on their own tastes, preferences and gaming enjoyment as to who will receive a prize. They will take into account any double or unfair voting in the normal rating. To balance uneven or unfair votes.

The theme will be announced when the jam starts.

After the jam ends, a 1 week rating period starts, in which people can play and rate all of the submitted games.

Don't forget to leave feedback on any game you rate! It's more helpful than just a number, and it helps them find your game ð.

Note: You need at least 10 ratings to be considered for winning in any of the categories. So make sure you play a lot of games so your game will have a higher chance of getting rated!

*The voting is open, but we reserve the right to take any submissions down that are clearly vote brigaded.

** The number of needed ratings to be considered a winning will be adjusted according to the number of participants.


Yes, this Game Jam will have prizes for the winners ð. These prizes are made available by our sponsor and organizer GoedWare.

Let's start by saying that if you press that join button and upload a game before the deadline, you are already a winner!  Having fun while creating and finishing your game project is an achievement in itself!  That experience is more valuable than money, but we do have some real prizes for the winners also ð.

We have a public vote with prizes and we also have a jury ranking (see these prizes under the public vote) with prizes.

# Easter Egg Challenge
 
During our 5th Anniversary Edition we held this challenge for the first time and we thought it would be fun to keep this extra prize during this new Game Jam edition:

We will give away an extra fun prize  on top of the prizes that are already there for the cutest, smartest, funniest, cleverest, etc. Easter Egg in your games.  It may be a joke, a super power-up, a short-cut or whatever. But most of all, let it fit the game and give the user a sense of awe.

We will add a separate spoiler channel in Discord and a thread in the community where people can tell about their found Easter eggs and what they thought of them. The judges will then determine the winner based on all the experiences.

While submitting your game, there will be a separate field where you can fill in how people can find your Easter egg. After the Jam we will share this info with everyone so everyone can find and enjoy the Easter eggs in all your games.

PRIZE: That remains a surprise, but we suspect you'll definitely appreciate it ð!

Discord
All the winners get a fancy Discord server role ð.

* Because the organizers already know the theme in advance, we will merely be participators. If one of us gets voted to be winner of a category or the overall winner, prizes will be awarded to the next person instead.

** The prizes may change a little bit before the Game Jam starts, but will mostly contain the content as it is shown now. Once the Game Jam has started the prizes will not change anymore!


In my experience, here is what you need to do if you want to win one of the top spots:

Make your game easy to understand for new players. This is a super common trap a lot of game jam games fall into.  Start thinking about your tutorial or how you want to teach your mechanics right from the beginning!
Usually it's a good idea to make your game not too hard to win. People spend roughly five to fifteen minutes on each game. In most cases they won't have enough time to reach a super high level of mastery. Keep that in mind when balancing the difficulty.
Quality over quantity. Keep your game super simple! This is important in this jam but every bit of extra polish can really make your game stand out in a short jam like this.
Take risk. The winning games are usually those who were brave enough to try something completely new and crazy (while also following the other three tips above). 

Obviously there are exceptions to all rules but still, I hope it helps. ð

329740,https://itch.io/jam/rpg-developer-bakin-easter-2023-game-jam,RPG Developer Bakin Easter 2023 Game Jam,15,"Welcome to the RPG Developer Bakin Easter 2023 Game Jam!

I am Companion Wulf and, with Easter just around the corner, I figured I'd host a game jam to celebrate my favourite time of the year. The reason: CHOCOLATE! That's the only reason, right?! Oh, and cute little bunnies!
The additional purpose of this game jam is to bring the RPG Developer Bakin community together - both veteran jammers and those new to the engine - to get their creative juices flowing.
So, let's move onto the essentials.
The Theme
The theme must be Easter, of course!
Anything that involves or revolves around Easter. It can be any genre, from modern to fantasy to horror.
Prizes
Yes, there are prizes, which are yet to be finalized.
At the moment, the prizes (subject to change) are:
GRAND PRIZE WINNER
A Mixx Chargemat wireless charging mouse mat (approx. $25 value)1
2 official DLCs (winner's choice)2
2 of my Bakin assets packs (winner's choice)
FIRST RUNNER-UP
1 official DLC2
1 of my Bakin assets packs
Mixx Air Point Wireless Mouse (approx. $12 value)1$15 Steam gift card or PayPal payment
SECOND RUNNER-UP
1 official DLC2
1 of my Bakin assets packs$10 Steam gift card or PayPal payment
Every participant will also receive an exclusive ""trophy"" model recognizing participation in the game jam, with additional versions for the winner and two runners-up.
1 No cash alternative is available.
2 Recipients of official DLCs can redeem keys for existing or future DLCs.  Â¶ I will keep track so there's no cheating! But you must let me know which ones you'd like.
Official Rules
These are the rules for submission. Please read them carefully to avoid ineligibility.
Submissions MUST be created in RPG Developer Bakin. Submissions NOT created in Bakin will be disqualified.Â¶ If a game does not appear to be made in RPG Developer Bakin it will be disqualified during the judgement period (we are/will become aware of any ""suspect"" ones).
The theme must contain something to do with Easter - whatever that is! - and it must be noticeable.
Sumissions must be new, created for the game jam, not previously published or submitted to other game jams. The intention behind this is to ecourage NEW games.
Submissions must NOT contain copyrighted materials or resources you don't have permission to use. Things like official DLCs or others' resources are fine (but read their EULAs if there are any).Submissions must be in English. (Unfortunately, we can't speak other languages.)
Submissions must not contain NSFW content (such as sexual scenes). Mature content may be acceptable but let me know either by putting ""(18+)"" in the title or by messaging me in Discord.
SUBMISSION DATES
The gam jam will start on 6 April 2023 at midnight GMT and will end on 30 April 2023 right before midnight GMT.
JUDGEMENT!
AmalgamAsh, Flawmore and I will judge each submission and we will decide on the winners, which I will announce in live-stream on or around 14 May 2023.
I will be live-streaming gameplay of submissions to announce the winner and the prizes will be distributed the week following the announcement.
Winners will also be notified in the Discord server via message.
Prizes needing to be mailed will also have a tracking number and may take a bit longer than cash or DLC prizes (depending on country and postal service).
Criteria
The criteria for judging submissions will be based on the following:
Easter Theme - How obvious the Easter theme is in your submission.
Game Design - How well-designed is your submission? How well are the cameras implemented? Is the game enjoyable to play? The style of the assets doesn't matter.
Story/Plot - How much of a plot does the submission contain? Is the storyline consistent?
Questions
If you have any further questions, you can ask in Discord and I'll update this page accordingly.
Happy Creating!"

329737,https://itch.io/jam/p5js-3,p5.js Game Jam #3,2,"Welcome to the p5.js Game Jam #3
                      
This is a 72-hour game jam that is held every month specifically for p5.js coders! (hosted by a coder in the p5 community)
Time:
May 12: Theme is announced + jam starts at 12pm noon GMTMay 15: Jam ends + voting starts at 12pm noon GMTMay 21: Voting ends + results at 12pm noon GMT!!


                      
Every single jam will have a voting phase which usually opens around the start of the month. Note that you can vote for multiple themes at the same time but only once so MAKE YOUR CHOICE WISELY!!

The theme will be announced at 12pm noon (GMT) on May 12th so stay tuned!!
Loading...


                      
Ratings is set to public, meaning everyone can rate!
There will be 4 categories to rate:
Enjoyment: How does the game feel? Is it fun?...Creativity: How original, creative the game is...Theme: Does the game stick to the theme or at the very least has some sense of the theme in it?Art + Audio: Does the game have great graphics/sfx/music?...

                       

Here are some of the rules we must all go by:

All projects must be made from p5.js (or any language associates with the Processing Foundation). I have my own way of finding it out! :) You can use any kind of text editor or engine (vscode, sublime, notepad++, ...) but only with languages linking with the Processing Foundation (preferably p5.js)!
Anyone can participate in the jam, no matter whether he or she are an experienced coder or just started their first project!! Although those below 13 years of age should have a parent or guardian to upload their games.
The majority of the game must be made during the jam. That means you cannot submit pre-made games (we do check). Yes, you can use pre-existing code/sfx/music if you have the rights but I would recommend building from scratch! :)
You must upload the game onto itch.io and pricing must be ""no payments"" or ""$0 or donate"". Anyone who simply just puts a link to the project in the description will be disqualified. Also, try to make the game easy to access; players can download and play right away, or just play the game in browser!
No NSFW, gore/violence content or rude language. Keep this page as clean as your code ð
No cheating with theme poll.
You cannot edit your submissions after voting has begun.
No vote hacking.
Be polite! If you see any kind of bullying, you can always report!

If you want to find teammates, show everyone your game, or simply chat with others, this is the official discord group for this jam! :)



Well that is it! :) If there is anything confusing, just ask me in the community section! :)

There is no prize (except getting featured in future jams), but remember, this is just for fun! The sole purpose of this jam is to push this small but amazing community to thrive!! So, with that being said, have a great weekend everybody ð

Check out the p5.js library, online editor, reference sheet; or the Processing Foundation page!
Teeny tiny tip: follow me on twitter, where I will more likely publish the theme on time hehe :) itch.io doesn't have schedule mode so... ð

329782,https://itch.io/jam/arcjam-2023,Îrcjam 2023,13,"Arcjam 2023 is organised by Arcweave, in collaboration with the Hellenic American College.

ð® About the Jam
Arcjam is a game design event where you use Arcweave to design and publish a short game in 72 hours.

The term âgameâ is to be taken in the most general sense, meaning any kind of interactive experience, story, puzzle, graphic novel, et al. Surprise us!
A paid Arcweave subscription is not required for participation.




The Arcweave interface.
For help on how to use Arcweave to design games, you can watch the Basic Tutorial Series on Youtube or read the Docs.
Previous Arcjams
This is the second Arcjam. The previous one was organised in 2021 and participants made some impressive things happen.



The live streaming video presenting all entries and announcing the winners.
You can see the previous winners on the Arcjam Hall of Fame, on the Arcweave website, and play all the entries on the 2021 jam's page.
And now, it's your time to make history.
Collaboration or solo
Arcjam participants can work alone or collaboratively. Remember, Arcweave offers real-time collaboration (for the free plan as well), so find the right partner and go for it!
Theme
Upon the jamâs opening, you will receive a theme, which you can incorporate in your game. You won't be disqualified if you don't, but its organic incorporation will be one of the criteria during the voting process (see further below).
Language
All submissions must be written in English.
Artwork
Graphics and illustrations add not only beauty, but also a whole extra layer of communication between the game and the player. Therefore, you are very much encouraged to include them in your submission. (On the other hand, you donât have to.)
If you do include images, remember: whether you use your own, your teamâs, or someone elseâs artwork, you have the responsibility to clear rights and permissions for any artwork used in your submission. Arcweave and Arcjamâs organisers hold no liability for any contestant using unauthorised material.
Abusive content

Games and comments promoting hate speech, racism, sexism, and any other form of discrimination against groups or individuals will not be tolerated by the Arcjam organisers or the itch.io platform. The same applies to bullying of any kind and inflammatory comments (i.e. trolling).
Sensitive content
If your game has sensitive content or/and is not suitable to be played by kids, please make this explicitly clear. Specify the gameâs age restrictions both in its description on its itch page and its Metadata fields. (See below, under ""Submitting your game."") 

ð¥ New Arcweave Features ð¥
Arcweave has evolved since the previous jam and now offers more flexibility and features at your disposal.
â Visited element checks
No need to explicitly create variables for everything any more. If you want to check if the player has taken a specific route, you can check whether specific elements have been visited.
ð² Arcscript code in connection labels
Assign values to variables while exiting an element or manipulate option text using if conditions.
ð¹ Audio
Arcweave can now play audio. Create your game's soundscape by attaching audio files to your elements. Add atmos/music loops and one-shot barkings, dialogue lines, and sound effects.
ð¬ YouTube embedding
You can now embed YouTube videos as element covers, instead of images.
ð§ Components visible in Play Mode
Play Mode now shows the current element's attached components. You can use this to show the current speaker or an inventory list.
ð Enhanced debugging
Along with monitoring the variables during Play Mode, the debugger now allows real-time assignments and a handy Undo last choice button. You can also Quickstart Play Mode from here, i.e. from any element, to test your story without restarting all the time.
Therefore, more space for experimentation since the previous jam. If you have questions on how to use Arcweave's features, our Discord community will be happy to help.

ð Submitting Your Game
1. Make your game's Play Mode public
Before submitting your project, make sure youâve made its Play Mode public from within Arcweave, so that other people can play it.
You can choose to make only the Play Mode of your project public (keeping your boards unaccessible) or the whole project (if you want to also share your modus operandi).
To do either, click on the Share (the paper plane icon) on the screenâs top right and choose âShare.â Then, make a choice from the dropdown menu and copy the relevant link.
2. Register your game on itch
To submit your game to arcjam, first make an itch.io page for it:
1. Log in on itch.io (or register, if you donât have an account already).
2. On your [Dashboard], choose âCreate new project.â
3. Under the [Edit game] tab, fill in the gameâs info (title, genre, etc), with particular attention to the following:

choose â$0 or donateâ for [Pricing]. Players must be able to access the jamâs submissions for free.
under [Details]>[Description], write a blurb for your game and also its Arcweave Play Mode URL. Very important!
if your game has age restrictions, add a detailed warning in the same [Description].
on [Visibility & access], make sure you save the project as Public.
give your game an iconic, killer cover and [Upload Cover Image].

Some fields are irrelevant to the jam, like [Kind of project], [Uploads], and [Release status], so choose whatever suits you. You wonât be uploading files anyway, since Arcweave games run from their own link and not from their itch.io webpages.
4. Under the [Metadata] tab, under [Audience & Content], please specify any age restrictions that your game may have. If your game is not suitable for children of any age, please tick both boxes AND add a detailed warning in the previous sectionâs [Description].
5. Under the [More] tab, choose [Admins] and add the itch profiles of your collaborators in the game. They also need an itch account, if they are to vote separately in the jam.
Thatâs it! You are now ready for your submission to Îrcjam!
3. Submit your game to the jam
To do so:

On this page, click Join jam and Submit your project.
Under [Existing game], choose your game from the dropdown menu.
Submit!

Good luck!

After the Jam
Voting
Every participant and their team members will be able to vote for other peopleâs submissions. Voting will open on the jamâs closing date and time and it will rank games according to the following criteria:

Quality of writing: this refers to general language skills and how language is used to convey emotion, support your gameâs subject, and carry its thematic statement—if any.
Narrative: this refers to your gameâs narrative elements (plot, characters, structure, inner journey, twists, finale, etc.) and to how they function together and contribute to the playerâs experience.
Mechanics: this is about how your gameâs inner workings transform to user experience. Does it have puzzles? An original scoring system? How does the plot advance? Does the player level up?Theme incorporation: have you managed to fit the theme in your game in an organic way?
Presentation: games that rely heavily on text may not focus much on presentation, so those that do deserve a bonus. This criterion includes the use of images, video, audio, and any creative use of Arcweaveâs formatted text.

Note: if you use video and/or audio  in your game, narrative-related criteria (Quality of Writing, Narrative, and even Mechanics) may apply to them as well, them being part of the whole experience.
Prizes
Apart from the sheer thrill of entering a game jam, the Arcweave team will reward the 3 top-ranked games with prizes from the following prize pool:
ð¥ a 1-year subscription to Arcweave Pro (valued at $240),ð¥ a $100 Steam gift card, andð¥ a $50 
Steam gift card.
âPrize poolâ means that the first winner gets to choose from all prizes, the second from the remaining, and the third one takes what is left.
After the announcement of the winners, each of them must contact the organisers to claim a prize from the pool. If a winner doesn't respond within 3 days from the jam's results, the prize will be transferred to the next highest-rated game. Please note that this only transfers the prize and not the winning position itself; in other words, even if a winner fails to claim a prize, their game is still listed as one of the winning ones.
Arcjamâs Hall of Fame
Finally, the highest-ranked games will be hosted on Arcweave's website, on a special Hall of Fame, as in the previous Arcjam, where they will be featured for everyone to play, forever, and ever, and ever… 
Plus, the link to all entries will always be available for an equally infinite amount of time.

FAQs
I don't know how to use Arcweave. How can I join Arcjam?
Arcweave is super easy to learn. Create a free account and start creating right away. You can even collaborate with someone more experienced with it and, when you feel like trying more complicated things (like if/else conditions), our tutorials are here to support you. Plus, we would be delighted to see you in Arcweave's Discord community, where no question is left unanswered.
Can I write my game in a language other than English?
Yes, as long as you are prepared to do double the work, since an English version must be included as well. In other words, you can use another language as an option (e.g. a ""Choose language"" menu, at the game's starting screen), but you must provide the option to fully play the game in English.
Can I write my game using software or game engines other than Arcweave?
Sorry, but no. This may change in the future but, for now, it's plain vanilla: we are eager to see how you can push Arcweave's boundaries in new, creative ways. The Play Mode is the final product.
(There are plenty of jams out there without game engine restrictions, so you're welcome to go crazy with them. And if you use Arcweave, we'd love to see the result!)
How close do I have to stick to the jam's theme?
How long is a piece of string? (Or an integer?)
If you incorporate the theme into your game in an organic way, you'll get more points for 'Theme incorporation' than someone who hasn't done so. That's all. 
Don't be afraid to face the theme. See it as another stimulus that can spark your creativity.
How many people can I collaborate with?
There is not limit to the number of people your team can have. Just be clear with the credits—it's nice to see who does what in a project. Also, all of them should have an itch.io account and join the jam, so they can vote the games afterwards.

So, what are you waiting for? Join the jam now, to stay up to date with news and notifications. And visit Arcweave's Discord channel, to join users and devs discussions about everything Arcweave.

Metroidvanias. A popular game genre among indie devs (you probably know Hollow Knight, Ori or Axiom Verge) based on Super Metroid and Castlevania in which you explore the map to find upgrades. In this game jam, I challenge you to make a Metroidvania game in a month! If you still have no idea what I'm talking about, you can check what is a metroidvania.

   Rules
1. Assets should all be made during the jam period. General purpose code, designing, bases and models, placeholders, and story can be made before the start of the jam. Here's clarification.
2. External assets can be used if you have the rights to and leave credit to the author when submitting in the ""External assets"" field when required. Of course, the assets you choose don't have to be made during the jam.
3. Incomplete games are accepted, so don't be anxious making a complete game! But your submission should be playable.
4. Teaming is accepted and there is no maximum team members.
5. You are free to use any engine and tools you want, and none is encouraged over any other.
6. The game needs to have a PG-13 rating or below. To be clear: no nudity, excessive swearing, no gore (for the subtleties of that one, refer yourself to these two posts: Post 1 and Post 2)
7. Your game should be free! You understand that selling it will cut out your ratings. You can put it on a sale for the duration of the rating period and set it back to its normal price after that.
8. I'm accepting late entries until 24 hours after the end of the submission period. In order to submit late, first publish your game to itch, and then send me the link, either on Discord or in the Community tab. Uploads will also be unlocked, so if you have a bug fix to publish, do it during this time!
9. Your game must follow the theme! The theme is mandatory this time around! If it obviously doesn't, your game can get disqualied. Don't forget the other participants will also rate your game based on this criteria!

Don't know how to get started? You can read this blog post by yumaikas for useful tips and visit this collection of previous jam winners!



Mandatory theme: TBA
For the 5th anniversary, theme suggestions will be provided by the previous jam winners, and the mandatory theme will be selected by the host from these suggestions. It will be announced on the start of the jam.


   Rating 
Games will be rated on these criteria:

â Enjoyment
 Did you enjoy playing the game? Was it a frustrating experience? Did the game keep you hooked?
â Originality
 Did this game stand out in any way? Did a mechanic surprise you? Perhaps the game took a creative approach towards a certain theme? Did the game focus on a concept you had never seen before?
â Presentation
 Was the game delivered in a good way? How consistent was the aesthetic? This criteria is based on the art, the music, the design, the writing, etc. and how each of those fields mesh together.
â Metroidvania
 Does this game belong in this jam? Was the Metroidvania aspect subtle or could you clearly say it was one? If you're not sure, you can check the page linked at the top.

â Relevance to the theme
 To what extent did the game follow the theme? Was it obvious? Was the integration done in a creative or interesting way?

Theme: to be revealed.. on the Discord! (How else can we get all your wonderful reaction emojis? We are nourished by them, you know)
KickoffWe will kick off this game jam at 6pm on May 19th at 6pm Eastern time, on @meanderingleaf's Twitch channel. 

This game jam will be using an experimental bot that will help you document and reflect upon our development progress during the game jam. This bot will guide you through the creation of small video updates on your game, help you assess your progress, and direct feedback and discussion on your project with jammers. This will require you to take breaks at three set times during the jam so you can interact with the bot and other jammers.
Much of this game jam will be spent crafting updates on your development process, and critiquing the work of the other jammers. It is a chance for connection and a chance to collectively identify what it means to 'continue'.  It's going to be great.


After the game jam is complete, your game will be played (and enjoyed) by two streamers.First will be Kirbgonefishin on May 25th at 8pm Eastern time. A few weeks later at a date TBA, TigerJ will also stream all the entries. You might also get a mystery stream by @meanderingleaf, time permitting. Join us for some evenings of gameplay and laughter.One winner who creates the best documentation of their development process using the bot (as voted on in post-jam showcases) will receive a $50 Steam gift card.

This game jam is part of an academic study. By joining this jam, you will also be joining a study of how people develop long-term game development skills during, and after, a game jam.  The full information about what we will be observing, how we will be observing it, and how we will report the data collected can be found  here, and you will have to acknowledge the data use before joining our Discord server.Those younger than 18 who are joining this jam must first get parental permission. Please have your parents / guardians review and sign this form and email it to tfaas@iupui.edu.
We hope to have you join & help us to understand where and how game jams have post-jam effects!

Key facts and info on Wildlife Trafficking:Wildlife trafficking is the second biggest direct threat to species, following habitat destruction. 
Itâs a huge business with smuggled goods valued at $10 billion a year, and involves tens of thousands of species and millions of wild plants and animals. 
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found that 958 species are at risk of extinction directly because of international trade. 
Wildlife trafficking not only impacts plant and animal populations, but also humans who rely on wildlife for vital resources and functional ecosystems for major industries.
Of the 1.2 million African elephants that lived in 1980, fewer than 420,000 remain, largely due to illegal poaching.
Tigers have disappeared from 95% of their original range in Africa, and only about 4,000 to 5,000 still exist in the wild.
Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked wild mammal; one million have been poached from the wild in the past 15 years. 
Species of both cacti and orchids are faced with extinction from overexploitation.Read the full article this list was originally published in and learn more about the issue https://www.ecowatch.com/wildlife-trafficking-facts.html

You have a limited timed window also to make such games. Most games made via a jam often are incomplete, proof of concepts, or demos.Rules of the Preggo Game Jam...You can only start your game project after May 1st (not prior) and you have three weeks work and submit your project. The final day you can submit your project will be on May 22nd at 11:59 p.m.-Pregnancy has to be central to the game in some way. Not everything has to be related to it of course, but it should be featured throughout. This basically means that you can't feature pregnancy in one scene only/just as an ending.  -Showing birth is permitted, though any human (or human-adjacent) children cannot simply be abandoned. It is up to the game's creator how they handle this, an example would be putting in a nursery or similar facility that would take in any children.  -NSFW content is permitted as well, though a warning must be put in to let the players know.  -Any and all games must comply with itch.io's own rules of content  -Creators are not bound to a specific engine or type of game; Anything from Text Adventure to 3D game is permitted  -Fetishes besides pregnancy can be included in games, though they shouldn't shift focus away from pregnancy and need to be disclosed in a warning similar to NSFW contentContest and Rewards...At the end of the month, a few select judges will be going over all the submitted games. The top 3 games that have the best scores will be offered a choice of a $60 cash prize or one free full body art commission from a few select artists in the community. In order to be eligible for rewards, your project must be playable on a windows platform.Criteria that the judges will base their scores will be focused in three different areas.-Pregnancy Content-Story-GameplaySpecial Notes:-If your game is chosen as a winner and you wish to receive a cash reward, you will need to have a paypal account.-If your game is chosen as a winner and you wish to have character art created, I will send you a list of approved artists that you can pick from. Please prepare art references for the character you wish to have made.-If your game is chosen as a winner and I reach out to you but do not get a response within a 1 week period, I will move to the next closest winner to offer them the prize instead.Final Mentions...Remember the goal of this jam is to celebrate the month of mayternity and pregnancy. Lets support a community who wants to celebrate pregnancy in all it's aspects and those who have the talent to make video games with such themes.Also this is my first game jam (with hopefully more to come in the future) so please be patient as I figure specific details out.

We've seen adventure games grow and evolve so much since their humble beginnings. Some might argue it's the puzzles, others might say it's retro graphics, or perhaps the storyline - or maybe even a little bit of everything. An adventure game can mean so many different things.

We want to encourage creativity and trying new things, so with that in mind, we want you to make whatever an adventure game means to you. Text adventures, modern 3D environments, point-and-clicks, hybrids, everything inbetween, or something entirely different. We love it all!

It doesn't matter if you were just introduced to the genre, or have been playing these kinds of games since you were a kid. It doesn't matter if you're already a developer and working for a company, or if you've never even thought about making a game before this moment. Whatever your situation, we're inviting you to join us!

Community - Best Practices - Tools & Resources - FAQ - About Us
Rules:
There are no themes to follow when participating in Adventure Jam. We only ask that you create an adventure game, e.g. point-and-clicks, text parsers, walking simulators, etc. If youâre still unsure about what is considered to be an adventure game, we recommend checking out the definition on Wikipedia for a good idea. That said, we are not purists! If you would like to experiment and try to communicate what an adventure game can be in an unconventional way, we'd love to see it!Constructing the game itself is not allowed until the beginning of the jam date. However, you are allowed to assemble your team (if you choose to have one), write your story/dialogue, and make a list of your game's needs and share it with your team.You are free to reuse any assets that you have made in the past, or use freeware or commercially available assets. This includes music, sound effects, models, et cetera. We only ask that you do not begin collecting or creating any assets specific to your AdventureJam entry until the jam begins! (If using freeware or commercially available assets, please credit the original creators.)Game submissions must be free on itch.io so that all participants can play your game without money being a barrier for entry. Implementing a pay-what-you-want model with a $0 minimum is allowed, but please refer to the Payment & Pay-What-You-Want section under our Best Practices page.We do not allow copies of existing games to be uploaded as entries to Adventure Jam. For example, taking Kingâs Quest I and changing the title and reskinning the game is not enough to make it your game. We will remove any entries that break this rule. We love seeing participants explore new ideas, and we trust you can come up with something great on your own!Use content warnings to clearly communicate what players will experience when they play your game. Sensitive content includes - but is not limited to - violence (including cartoon violence), sexual themes, depictions of abuse, depression and suicide.You are allowed to update your game post-jam. The addition of content (new writing, art, music, etc.) should be kept in a separate build during the voting period. We ask that you still keep the finished jam version available for play/download and make it clear in the filenames/description that this is the definitive version that should be played for voting purposes! Updates to fix bugs and add accessibility options do not need to be in a separate build, as these improve the experience for the player and ensure that they can play the game from start to finish.
Voting:
Once the jam has ended, all participants are encouraged to play and rate as many entries as possible. Voting will continue for one month.

Voting Categories:

329587,https://itch.io/jam/platformer-challenge-4,Platformer Challenge #4,82,"TASK
Make a platformer which contains some motion-inducing platforms

INSPIRATION
Try to think of different ways a stationary platform can affect the motion of the player. For example, are there springs that bounce the player up into the air, is the surface of the platforms slippery ice or perhaps something stickier or with more resistance like tall grass that slows the player when they walk through it. There could be sinking sand that pulls the player downwards, or rivers that slowly push the player in a particular direction. Wind currents could affect the playerâs motion when on land or in the air. There could be speed boost platforms to give a quick burst of speed. You could even use the slopes of the terrain to affect the speed of the player. You could have conveyor belts, one way platforms and thereâs also things like jumping inside a barrel and then having it shoot you in a direction like in Donkey Kong.

Try to think about what could make the motion-inducing platforms more interesting. For example, do springs only go straight up or are some set at an angle, are springs activated when landing on top of it or will any side bounce the player, can slippery ice melt away, does a sticky platform prevent a player from jumping but has no effect on running speed or is jumping the only way to get out of the sticky platform, does sinking sand lead to another area to explore, are there blocks on the sinking sand which can also sink when standing on them, does sinking sand flow downwards from the sky so that the player can jump up it, do fast flowing rivers have floating spikes or enemies within it to dodge, does a pool of water rise and fall causing floating objects to move with it, do wind currents change direction, are there fans blowing air underneath the player to provide some uplift, do speed boost platforms provide extra speed for a set amount of time or is it until the player crashes into a wall, do slopes loop around like in Sonic, do conveyor belts have boxes dropping on them or switches to turn them off, do barrels shoot the player in one set direction or is it rotating so you have to time the angle you want.

If you aren't sure if something is allowed as a motion-inducing platform, I would say yes it is allowed. For example, a rising bubble or an enemy when jumped on could explode and cause the player to jump. An enemy could turn into a lump of sticky toffee when it is killed and then you could even combine it with a conveyor belt to stick upside down to reach a new place or to stay still in a windy environment. Instead of affecting the playerâs motion there could be platforms that affect the motion of bullets by making them bounce off it. The player could walk into a massive snowball and then it rolls the player with it as itâs getting bigger and bigger until it crashes into a wall. The player could be a rolling ball that can morph into a cube to stop motion or a spiky cube to stick on a wall. There could be ziplines. Maybe thereâs a sticky blob platform floating in the air that can only be passed through if the player dashes. There could be an enemy that is flying with a giant magnet which lifts the player off the ground with an invisible magnetic force. I'm sure there will be other examples like this but if in doubt, they will all be allowed.

You may also want to ask yourself what sort of character do you want to have in your game? Does this character of yours have a special ability? (A weapon, magic, dash, roll, glide, swim, no ability but looks cute etc) Does this special ability affect how your player interacts with the platforms?

USEFUL INFO
This jam is open to everyone of all skill levels
You will have 1 month to make your game. You don't have to use all of that time to make your game. So you can relax, take time off and come back to it, plan it out a little bit, try to learn something new for your game, have time to redo it over, have the time to join other jams that have overlapping deadlines etc
Your game doesn't have to be finished, a demo of what you have got so far is perfectly fine
If you miss the deadline, don't worry, you just won't be entered
Your game can even be an updated version of a previously made game
Your game can be 2D or 3D
All of the different types of platformer games are allowed in this jam (side scrollers, endless runner, puzzle based, metroidvania style, single screen room escapes, or anything else with platforms in it)
Exporting your game as a HTML5 file is the most accessible way for people to play your game but downloadable games are fine too, but please be aware that I am only on windows and that if others are too, it can result in less people rating your game if exporting for only apple or linux
If your game is not free, it won't get played by me and possibly others so you may want to consider making it free for just the jam period
RULES
You must use assets that you created or have the legal right to use. Crediting the creators is encouraged
You can work alone or in a team. If in a team, crediting all of the team members is encouraged

329616,https://itch.io/jam/talp2023,Text Adventure Literacy Jam 2023,29,"Introduction
This is the third annual Text Adventure Literacy Jam.
The aim of the jam is to write a text adventure that is suitable for players with little or no prior experience of playing text adventures. The game must include an in-game tutorial.
The concept of the Text Adventure Literacy Jam is based on the Text Adventure Literacy Project (TALP) launched by Chris Ainsley in 2019. The goals of the TALP were threefold:

To encourage authors to create text adventures that target beginners to the genre.
To teach a new generation the skills required to play classic text adventures and, in doing so, encourage them to create their own games.
To provide an easy acronym (TALP) to search for beginner-friendly text adventures on the internet.

If you need some inspiration, see the games in Text Adventure Literacy Jam 2021 and Text Adventure Literacy Jam 2022.
Please join our Discord server to chat, ask questions and communicate with the organisers:  https://discord.gg/57uuPGrCsR

Rules
Despite the name, this is a competition, not a game jam. All entrants must adhere to the following rules. Any games that do not adhere to the rules will be disqualified.
See the guidelines below for further elaboration of the rules, general advice and recommendations.

The game can be written in any programming language for any computing platform.
The game must be a text adventure, also known as parser-based interactive fiction.
The game must use the keyboard for input. Input is in the form of text commands expressed as simple English sentences.
The text commands must be processed by a parser.
The game must use text output to show the results of each command.
The game can use graphics and/or audio, but this is not mandatory.
The game must be in English.
The game's title must have a '(TALP)' suffix on itch.io.
The game must have clear instructions on how to play.
The game must have a tutorial at the start of the game. The tutorial can optionally be turned on and off.
The game must have at least five puzzles, not including any 'give-away' puzzles in the tutorial.
The game must not include any offensive content. Any game with adult content must have a content warning at the start of the game.
The game should preferably be merciful or polite on the text adventure cruelty scale.
The game must be an original work that has not been previously published. The game can be made public 24 hours before submissions close.
The game must not contain any copyrighted material, other than your own, unless you have obtained permission to use that material or it is covered by the fair use provisions of the copyright act in your country.
The game must be free to play for the duration of the voting period.

Guidelines
The following guidelines provide additional advice and recommendations to assist with interpretation of the rules.
Platform
The game can run on any platform, from 8-bit and 16-bit retro computers to modern Android, iOS, Linux, Mac and Windows based operating systems, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones.
In order to have your game played and judged by the maximum number of people, it is recommended that you target the most common platforms. In any case, you must provide full details on how to download and play your game, including any emulators and/or interpreters necessary to play the game.
If providing a downloadable game, it is recommended that you also provide a browser-based version, if possible, as anyone can play your game in a browser.
If providing a browser-based game, it is recommended that you also provide a downloadable version for those that prefer to play offline, perhaps to use a screen reader.
Programming language
You can write the game in any programming language, but it is much easier to use one of the well-known adventure authoring systems, as this will have a strong support community and will already do a lot of the hard work for you, such as the parser and a library of commonly used functionality.
Common authoring systems for retro systems include:

DAAD
GAC (Graphic Adventure Creator)
PAWS (Professional Adventure Writing System)
The Quill

Common authoring systems for modern systems include:

ADRIFT (Adventure Developer & Runner - Interactive Fiction Toolkit)
Adventuron
Alan (Adventure LANguage)
Dialog
Hugo
Inform 6 using the standard library
Inform 6 using the PunyInform library
Inform 7
Quest
TAB (Text Adventure Builder)
TADS (Text Adventure Development System)
ZIL (Zork Implementation Language)

What is a text adventure?
A text adventure is a form of computer game that uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to communicate with the player. The player enters commands in simple English sentences. A parser processes the input to break the command into individual words and match these to patterns or grammar rules. If the player has entered a properly formed sentence that is understood by the game, then this is converted to actions that allow the player to move around the game world, examine things, manipulate things and interact with non-player characters in order to solve puzzles. In the process, the game reveals a story.
Text adventures were first developed on mainframes in the 1970s and became very popular in the home computer boom during the 1980s and early 1990s. Companies stopped producing commercial text adventures in the late 1990s, but they never died out, they just went underground. Many authoring tools were developed to make it easier for amateur authors to produce their own text adventures and these tools are still being developed or improved to this day.
Nowadays, text adventures are usually referred to as parser-based interactive fiction to distinguish them from other forms of text-based games and other forms of interactive fiction. There are many jams and competitions for text adventures and other forms of interactive fiction held each year.
Input
The keyboard may be a physical keyboard or a virtual keyboard on a touch screen.
The game may use additional touch, mouse, joystick or voice inputs, but the game must be completable with the keyboard alone.
Choice-based input should be avoided, but may be used sparingly, such as for a menu-based speech system or hint system. If minimal choice-based input is used, the options must still be selectable by keyboard.
The game may use two-word input (verb and noun) or multiple-word input. Remember that you are writing a game suitable for new players, so use the input that is easiest for them to use. For example, PUT THE CHICKEN IN THE OVEN is fairly easy for a new player to understand, but how do you express that in two words? Make sure you use lots of synonyms and various ways of achieving the same thing. For example, GIVE MEAT TO DOG and FEED DOG WITH MEAT should both achieve the same result.
Do not use SEARCH as a verb, unless it is a synonym for examine, it is an obvious thing to do (such as searching a dead body), or there is a hint to indicate that this is something you should do.
Processing
The parser is crucial to a text adventure. You do not need to know how the parser works, unless you are writing your own. All the established authoring systems provide a parser, so you will be safe if you use one of these.
Output
Output includes describing the current location in the game world, listing any exits from the current location, describing any objects in the current location, providing responses to each command and describing any changes in the game world due to the independent actions of non-player characters, timers and daemons.
There is no limit to the length of output text, but be considerate to the player. Long flowery descriptions should be avoided if they  are not important to the game. As a general rule, location descriptions and responses should be concise. Any scenery mentioned in location descriptions should be examinable.
Any messages related to the tutorial should be identified in some way, such as a different colour, italics or surrounded by square brackets, depending on the capabilities of your game or the game's interpreter.
Please be considerate to visually-impaired players, who may be using a screen reader to play your game. For example, if using ASCII graphics, provide an alternative text-only description for visually-impaired players.
Multimedia
Graphics, animation, music and/or sound effects may be used in your game to make it more appealing to a beginner. However, this is not mandatory and there must be nothing in the multimedia that provides hints that are not given in the text output.
Language
All text input and output must be in English, except for any 'flavour' text. 'Flavour' text may include things like signs, books, speech or puzzles that may be in a foreign language, alien language, fantasy language or code.
TALP suffix
TALP is an acronym for Text Adventure Literacy Project. The game's title must have a '(TALP)' suffix on itch.io. This is so that it can be easily found when doing an internet search. The TALP suffix does not need to appear within the game itself.
Instructions
Remember that you are writing a game for people that are new to text adventures, so you should write instructions with those people in mind. The instructions may be on the game page, in the game itself or both. If using both, consider writing long instructions on the game page and a summary (or memory jogger) in the game itself. Keep the instructions concise, as people hate reading instructions.
Consider using a HELP command for the in-game instructions.
Tutorial
In-game tutorials are very hard to write, so plan this carefully. Your tutorial should explain the screen layout and command prompt, how to refresh the location description when it scrolls off the screen, how to move about, how to examine things, how to pick things up, how to drop things and how to take an inventory to see what you are carrying.
You should consider a 'give-away' puzzle at the beginning of the game and walk the player through that puzzle. The puzzle can be 'on rails', whereby the player cannot do anything other than follow the tutorial. A better approach is to provide a 'smart' tutorial, where the tutorial provides guidance along the way, but the player can follow it or ignore it at their own discretion. Do not repeat the same tutorial hint over and over again.
For experienced players and anyone playing the game multiple times, allow the tutorial to be turned on and off using commands such as TUTORIAL ON and TUTORIAL OFF.
Puzzles
Text adventures typically consist of exploration, examination and manipulation of objects in order to solve puzzles. You can think of this as a text-based escape room. There is no restriction on the type of puzzles you use, but you should have a variety of puzzles, some easy and some not so easy. As this game is targeted at beginners, you should probably avoid very difficult puzzles.
All solutions to puzzles should be hinted at in subtle (or not so subtle) ways. Make sure you allow for different ways of expressing commands that the player will use to solve the puzzles. There should be little or no guess-the-verb, as this will cause the player to get frustrated and give up.
The solutions to puzzles should not require any specialist knowledge. As a general rule, everything needed to solve a puzzle should be provided in the game.
Consider providing a context-sensitive HINT command for when a player has missed or forgotten a hint, or runs out of ideas.
Content
There is no theme and no limitation on plot or story line.
Your ideas and inspiration can come from anywhere, but the writing and coding must be entirely your own work. Fan fiction and parodies of published works are permitted, subject to the fair use provisions of the copyright act in your country.
The game must not include any offensive content including hateful, racist, misogynistic or homophobic content, or anything that would make people feel bad about themselves.
Adult content (such as sexual references, swearing, violence and drug use) is permitted, but it must provide a content warning at the beginning of the game.
It is preferred that your game is G-rated (suitable for a general audience) and would appeal to children.
Cruelty scale
The text adventure community uses a 'cruelty scale' to measure how fair a game is to the player. This is a measure of fairness, not a measure of difficulty.
The scale was originally devised by Andrew Plotkin and has five ratings of merciful, polite, tough, nasty and cruel. As your game is intended for beginners, you should aim for a cruelty scale of merciful or polite.

Merciful means the player can never die or get into an unwinnable situation.
Polite means the player can die, but cannot get into an unwinnable situation.

In the case of a polite game, you can kill the player if they get into a dangerous, but avoidable, situation or they do something stupid. However, there must be no 'sudden death'. 'Sudden death' is death without warning. For example, you enter a location and get shot by poison darts or fall into a pit of man-eating crocodiles, even though there was nothing to indicate that there was any danger in that location.
If your game can kill the player, then it should include UNDO, so that they can go back one move without having to restart from the beginning or restore a saved game.
Publication
Neither the source code nor the story file or executable can be published in a public place prior to the submission closing date. You can send the game to testers, but this must not be done in a public forum.
If you are storing your source code in a repository, such as GitHub or GitLab, make sure it is in a private repository. You can make this public after the submission closing date.
When your game is ready for testing, it is recommended that you upload it to itch.io, mark it as private and add a password for access. You can then give the url and password to your testers via email or a private message.
You can submit your game any time before the submission deadline, but it should remain private if you submit early. You can make your game public on itch.io within 24 hours of the submission deadline.
Copyright
You retain the copyright to your game unless placing it in the public domain.
All works are copyrighted by default, but you should include a valid copyright statement at the start of the game, so that it is clear that it is not in the public domain. The copyright statement should include the year of publication and the copyright holder's name, e.g. 'Copyright © 2023 Joe Bloggs'.
If the game is in the public domain, then this should be stated instead of a copyright statement, e.g. 'This game is in the public domain'.
Any  licence restrictions should be made clear at the start of the game.
Testing
Games should be thoroughly tested by the author, then tested independently by other people. Try to allow at least two weeks for testing. This gives your testers about one week to thoroughly play and test your game and submit their feedback. That gives you about one week to do any bug fixes and enhancements and do a final round of testing if necessary.
You can request testers on the Community page or in the beta testing category at intfiction.org. Try to get three to seven testers. Ask testers for a commented transcript and any further comments and suggestions in a text file. If you are looking for anything specific (such as how long it took to play or were the puzzles too easy or too hard), let them know before they start testing.
As your game is meant to be targeted at beginners, try to include some new players in your test team. This can be friends, family or work colleagues.
Testers are your friends. Treat them with courtesy and respect. Listen to what they have to say and don't get defensive if you disagree with them. They are trying to help you and doing it for free.
Voting

Games are available for download, playing and voting from 00:00:00 UTC on 1 June 2023.
Anybody with an itch.io account can vote for games, including the organisers and prize donors.
Entrants cannot vote for their own game(s).
Entrants and judges are encouraged to promote the competition, but they must not encourage others to vote for a particular game, uprate a particular game or downrate particular games.
Judges can only vote once for each game. Any attempt to vote for the same game multiple times using multiple itch.io accounts will be carefully monitored by itch.io and the organisers. If any instances of cheating are detected, all those votes will be cancelled. If the cheating is instigated by an entrant, then that entrant's game will be disqualified.
Games will be rated on:

Story (plot, goal, prologue, atmosphere, gradual revealing of story, conclusion)
Writing (clarity, spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalisation)
Puzzles (originality, fairness, consistency with the game setting)
Implementation (technical aspects, lack of bugs, responses to unanticipated commands)
Tutorial
Documentation (any external instructions, game page, feelies)


Each category is rated from 1 star (poor) to 5 stars (excellent).

Prize Pool : $100
THEME: Quantum Jump
About
4MB Game Jam 2023 is the second edition of the 4MB Jam. It is a one month long game jam about creating a game that fits within four megabytes. This limitation challenges developers to come up with clever ways to store their program in the smallest way possible. If you have any questions or want to chat with the rest of the community, you can join our discord (link at the bottom).
There will be a theme this time, so don't start working on it until the jam begins, you have a full month to finish it so time shouldn't be an issue.
Rules
Due to really bad entries last time, we have revamped the rules and made them a bit more strict and detailed. For the full details, you can find them in this gist page. But here's a basic summary:
Your submission......is under 4 MB....is either a Windows or Ubuntu desktop application....doesn't violate Canadian federal law....is SFW....is a video game....is made within the allotted time....isn't a mod/hack....isn't an online multiplayer only game....doesn't stream nor download content from the internet....can be downloaded free for the duration of the judging period....isn't a web game. 
Dependencies which aren't shipped by default on either Ubuntu or Windows count towards the size of your game.
Judging
This time around, games will be ranked by judge using a custom ranking system instead of public voting to avoid the fiasco of last time. The judging period will be during the first half of June. Perhaps the whole month if there are many more submissions than anticipated.
Prizing
It's no trophy, but I'm currently working on something to get some sort of golden foil certificates of achievement for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place and community's choice awards. I'm still experimenting with the material at the moment, but winners should have something tangible to immortalize their winning. Here's a photo of the latest test:Photo linkPhoto Link 2
The winner of 1st place will also get what's in the prize pool. But if we get more than anticipated, the other winners could see some of that awarded to them as well.
If people are interested in contributing prizes for this jam, please contact Doigt on discord.

Rules
Games must consist of pixel art, voxel art, or 3D art with pixel art textures
This is a ranked jam with $500 in prizes! During submission, you MAY opt-in to be eligible for prizes. Up to 5 submissions will be awarded a prize: Crowd Favorite, 3x Judge Favorites, and Most Educational. (See prizes section for more details).
A secret theme will be announced when the jam starts. If you would like to suggest a theme, you can do so here: LINK. About one week before the jam, you will have an opportunity to vote on a theme.
You must have the rights to all assets you use in your game. It is highly encouraged that you and your team make all of the assets for your submission. However, any asset that you have the right to use may be used as long as you properly credit the assets *WITHIN* your game as well as on your submission page.
You can use any game engine you want.
Your game must be made within the time constraints of the jam. The game jam is 8 days long giving you a full week plus 1 day for final changes. You can update your game anytime **BEFORE** or **AFTER** the voting period.
Teams are encouraged (Max 3)! You can go solo but working with a team can be super fun and you'll learn a ton along the way! If you don't already have a team, feel free to search for one on our Discord channel. Max team size of 3.
Submissions must be free during the voting period. No one is going to play / vote on your game if they have to pay for it.
Content should be appropriate for all young people. This game jam should be safe and fun for all ages! If you wouldn't feel comfortable sharing it with someone who is 13 years old, then it doesn't belong in this jam. Heavy topics are allowed as well but please refrain from romanticizing/advocating for racism, sexism, transphobia, etc.
Prizes
During submission, if eligible, you may opt-in to be considered for the Most Educational prize.
1x Most Educational ($250 - via PayPal or Venmo)
Captain Coder and the 2 guest judges will review the dev-logs, blogs, and vlogs to determine which submission will receive the Most Educational prizes.
Note: Depending on the volume of submissions, this may take some time to complete. The judges will make a best effort to review and select a winner by the time voting has ended but make no guarantees on an exact timeline.

5x Dev-log, blog, or vlog Drawing($50 - via PayPal or Venmo)
Anyone who submits a dev-log, blog, or vlog and does not win the Most Educational prize will be entered into a raffle to win $50. 5 unique winners will be drawn from all eligible submissions. To be eligible, the submitted dev-log, blog, or vlog must have some amount of ""substance"" which expresses what the developer (or developers) learned as well as the resources they learned. I don't want to be super strict about this BUT this requirement is subjective and is in an effort to prevent someone from submitting a 10 second video / a 1 sentence blog and winning the raffle.
Eligibility
Everyone is encouraged to submit to this Jam regardless of eligibility! However, due to legal reasons, to be eligible to receive prizes, you must:
You must create and submit a dev-log, blog, or vlog sharing what you learned with the broader communityBe 18+ years old (13+ with parent/guardian consent)
Opt-in during the submission process
Have a PayPal or Venmo account that can receive money"
